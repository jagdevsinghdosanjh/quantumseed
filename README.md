In the garden of possibility, one seed spins.
Not left. Not right. Not yes. Not no.
But all — until you ask.

Welcome to QuantumSeed:
Where gates sculpt wonder,
And every learner becomes a quantum gardener.

# 🌱 QuantumSeed

**Planting the first qubit in every curious mind.**  
A poetic, modular Streamlit app designed to introduce quantum computing through metaphor, visualization, and educator-facing clarity.

---

## 🌌 Vision

QuantumSeed is a single-qubit simulator that blends quantum logic with poetic metaphor. It empowers educators and students to explore superposition, gate operations, and measurement — not just through math, but through metaphor and wonder.

---

## 🧠 Features

- **Streamlit-powered UI** with educator toggles and poetic overlays
- **Bloch sphere visualization** to show qubit evolution
- **Gate metaphors** that spark curiosity and deepen intuition
- **Student badge system** for engagement and recognition
- **Metaphor submission form** to invite learner creativity

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jagdevsinghdosanjh/quantumseed.git
   cd quantumseed
Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app

bash
streamlit run quantumseed_app.py
🌱 Educator Mode
Use the sidebar to:

Toggle Bloch sphere visibility

Enable poetic metaphors

Choose feedback mode: adaptive, guided, or minimal

✨ Contribute a Metaphor
Students and educators can submit poetic metaphors for quantum gates via the built-in form. All submissions are stored in data/student_submissions.json.

🏆 Badges & Recognition
QuantumSeed tracks student interactions and awards poetic badges based on gate mastery and metaphor engagement. Badge logic lives in badge_logic.py.

📬 Feedback & Collaboration
We welcome poetic minds, quantum educators, and curious contributors. Open an issue, submit a pull request, or plant a metaphor.
